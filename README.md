## Collaboration

QA Team **PSWE-06 Calidad y Pruebas de Software**

### Local QA environment

For collaborative QA, each person runs an independent local Appwrite instance
and test data. Place the QA package in the project root, then run:

```bash
bun install
docker compose -f qa-team/appwrite/docker-compose.yml up -d
bun run dev
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`. Docker Desktop, Node.js 20+ and Bun
are required. Local environment configuration is managed outside the
repository.
